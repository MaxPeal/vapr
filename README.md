[Sojourn Labs](http://www.sojournlabs.com) is designing a new type of electric
vehicle. As part of its operations, it runs a private cloud infrastructure to
host the software it uses. This is the master repository containing all of our
(hackish) scripts for anyone that would like to replicate our setup, warts and all.

Getting started
===============
Run `git submodule init` to pull the files you'll need to get started.
